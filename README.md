### Project Title
Predicting Customer Churn for Enhanced Customer Retention Using a Classification Model.
### Project Description
In the fiercely competitive business landscape, companies strive to maximize their profits and revenue margins. One key area where industry players focus their resources is customer retention. Keeping existing customers happy and loyal is crucial for sustaining business growth and long-term success.
The primary goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model that predicts customer churn with high accuracy. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, companies can proactively implement targeted retention strategies, reducing churn rates, and boosting customer loyalty.


**Project Objectives**

*Data Understanding and Preparation:* The first step of the project will involve understanding the content and quality of the provided data.Suitability of the data to answer the research question will also be examined. The data will be cleaned, preprocessed, and structured to ensure its suitability for training classification models.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* The data will be explored to gain insights into the patterns, trends and relationships related to customer churn. Guided by the Research Question, EDA will help in understanding the distribution of features, identifying correlations, and spotting any potential data challenges. The aim is to have a good sense of what the answer to the Research Question is and be armed with sufficient information for the next steps. Thus, provide support for or against the null hypothesis.

*Feature Engineering:* Relevant features will be selected, and new features will be engineered to enhance the model's predictive power.

*Model Selection and Evaluation:* Several classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting, will be considered for building the predictive model. The models will be evaluated using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

*Hyperparameter Tuning:* Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize the selected model's performance. Techniques like cross-validation and grid search will be employed to find the best hyperparameter values.

*Model Deployment:* The finalized classification model will be deployed to make real-time predictions on new customer data. A user-friendly interface or API will be developed to enable seamless integration with the company's existing systems.


A well-documented and deployed machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn in real-time will be obtained.
The successful implementation of this project will equip the company with a powerful tool to predict customer churn accurately, empowering the company to take proactive measures.
